So this is a very simple app that takes the titles of the most recent Reddit news depending the category you selected. 
The only options are mexico and videogames since the main focus of this little project is to find the most effective way to consume services from the Reddit API. 
I received some help from my mentor pache800 and that allowed me to find a simpler way to aproach populating a TableView with the titles directly taken from the internet. 
Hope you enjoy it :)
